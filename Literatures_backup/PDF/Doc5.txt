CW Ondr?ejov treats sewage from 362 PE in a single 806m2 bed planted with Phragmites australis. CW Spa´lene´ Por?´?c?´? treated wastewater from 700 PE from a combined sewerage until 2001 and then another part for additional 700 PE was completed in 2002. At present, there are six beds planted with a mixture of P. australis and Phalaris arundinacea with a total area of 5000m2. Constructed wetland Ondr?ejov treatment performance has been very steady over the period of operation and exhibited ‘‘typical’’ efficiency for organics (average BOD5 inflow and outflow concentrations of 198mgl1 and 18mgl1, respectively) and suspended solids (average inflow and outflow concentrations 204mgl1 and 9mgl1, respectively). Removal of phosphorus is steady but low with average inflow and outflow concentrations of 10.9mgl1 and 6.5mgl1, respectively. Average ammonia-N removal amounted to only 19.4% with an average outflow concentration of 22.8mgl1. Constructed wetland at Spa´lene´ Po?r?´c?´? treated diluted wastewater until 2002. After that about 700 people were connected directly to the sewerage without local pretreatment. The average inflow and outflow BOD5 concentrations for the whole period were 44.2 and 5.7mgl1, respectively. Average TSS removal amounted to 89.1% with an average outflow concentration of 7.9mgl1. Both systems are examples of well-operated constructed wetlands.

Introduction Presented at Multi Functions of Wetland Systems, International Conference of Multiple Roles of Wetlands, June 26–29, 2007, Legnaro (Padova) Italy 0011-9164/09/$– See front matter © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.desal.2008.02.042 have been used for wastewater treatment for about 40 years. The technology of wastewater treatment by means of constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow constructed wetlands (HF CWs) was started in Germany based on research by K€athe Seidel commencing in the 1950s [1–5] and by Reinhold Kickuth in the 1970s [6–9]. The first full-scale HF Kickuth’s type CW for treatment of municipal sewage was put in operation in 1974 in the community Liebenburg-Othfresen, Germany [6]. The results from this system were exceptionally good but the validity of these data has later been seriously questioned [10]. In 1981, HF constructed wetland was built in Weinitzen near Graz, Austria [11], and in 1983, a large experimental 4-bed HF system was built in Mannersdorf, Austria. The research unit has been intensively investigated between 1983 and 1989 [12,13]. In 1983, German ideas were introduced in Denmark and by 1987 about 80 HF CWs were built [14,15]. In 1985, following visits to existing German and Danish systems, first two HF CWs were built in the United Kingdom (here called reed bed treatment systems) and by the end of 1986, more than 20 HF CWs were designed [16]. In the 1990s, HF CWs were built in many European countries and became the most widely used concept in Europe [17]. Horizontal flow constructed wetlands in Europe are mostly used to treat municipal or domestic wastewater [17–20]. However, recently HF CWs have been used for various types of polluted waters including agricultural wastewaters [21–25], industrial wastewaters [26–34], stormwater run-off [35–39] and landfill leachate [40–45]. The first constructed wetland in the Czech Republic was built in 1989. However, this system was just a temporary solution, and therefore it was closed after few years of operation. Constructed wetlands in Ondr?ejov and Spa´lene´ Por?´?c?´? were built in 1991 and 1992 [46], respectively, and these systems are still in operation. The objective of this paper is to describe the treatment performance of these systems over the 15-year period of operation. 2. Material and methods Constructed wetland Ond?rejov, the first fullscale operational constructed wetland in the Czech Republic, was built in late 1991. It consists of a horizontal grit chamber, Imhoff tank and a single 806m2 bed filled with gravel (3– 15mm) and planted with common reed (Phragmites australis) (Fig.1). It is designed for 362 PE, and the average measured flow over the monitored period was 56.3m3d1. Constructed wetland in Spa´lene´ Po?r?´c?´? near Pilsen in western Bohemia was built in late 1992 for 700 PE (Fig.2). It consisted of Vortex-type grit chamber, Imhoff tank and four beds (2500m2 total area, 625m2 each) filled with gravel (2–4mm) and planted with P. australis and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) planted in bands perpendicular to water flow. In 2001, another part of equal size was added to treat wastewater from 700 PE. This time two beds (1250m2 each) were filled with gravel (4–16 mm) and planted with the same plants as the first wetland (Fig.2). The average flow over the monitored period was 201m3d1. Both constructed wetlands were sampled for BOD5, COD, TSS, TP, ammonia-N, and TN; CW Ond?rejov was also sampled for nitrate-N and TKN. CW Ond?rejov was sampled bimonthly until 1996; since then it has been sampled mostly quarterly. CW Spa´lene´ Por?´?c?´? was sampled monthly until 1999; since then it has been sampled bimonthly. All analyses were performed according to the Czech National Analytical Standards [47]. In both wetlands, sampling of aboveground biomass of Phragmites was carried out until 2003. Aboveground biomass was sampled during the peak standing crop in the period end-August Fig. 1. Constructed Wetland Ondr?ejov. Top = overall layout; bottom = detail of the inflow distribution zone.

Two samples from the inflow and two samples from the outflow zones were taken from a 0.25m2 quadrant every year. The vegetation in Spa´lene´ Por?´?c?´? was regularly mowed in early spring every year. Constructed wetland at Ond?rejov was harvested only once, in winter 2000/2001. 3. Results and discussion Constructed wetland Ond?rejov treatment performance has been steady over the period of operation and exhibited ‘‘typical’’ efficiency for organics (Table 1, average BOD5 raw, inflow and outflow concentrations of 192mgl1, 157mgl1 and 18mgl1, respectively, and average COD raw, inflow and outflow concentrations of 432mgl1, 344mgl1 and 53mgl1, Fig. 2.

Organic loading of vegetated beds was quite high with an average value of 110 kg BOD5ha1 d1 resulting in an average specific area of 5.5 m2 PE1. Removal of phosphorus (Table 2) is steady but low with average raw, inflow and outflow concentrations of 11.6 mgl1, 10.1mg l1 and 7.0 mgl1, respectively. Average ammonia-N removal (Table 3) amounted to only 14.8% (and 23.9% for vegetated beds only) with an average outflow concentration of 24.2 mg l1. The system performed well in terms of nitrate removal (Table 3) with an average outflow NO3-N concentration of only 0.58 mg l1. The average removal of total nitrogen (Table 4) was 41% Table 1 Removal of BOD5 and COD in constructed wetland Ondr?ejov during the period 1991–2004.

Vymazal [48] reported in his review an average nitrogen loading for HF constructed wetlands of 644g Nm2 yr1. Constructed wetland at Spa´lene´ Po?r?´c?´? treated diluted wastewater until 2002 because local septic tanks were left in operation when the first beds were built and also drainage and run-off waters were collected by the sewer system. The annual average inflow BOD5 concentrations were mostly <30mgl1 with the exception of 2000 when two extremely high concentrations were recorded (Table 5). When additional 700 people were connected directly to the sewerage without local pretreatment in 2002, the inflow concentrations increased substantially since 2003 (Table 5). The average inflow BOD5 concentrations were 24.5mgl1 and 122mgl1 in the first (until 2002) and second periods, respectively. The corresponding outflow concentrations were 4.2mgl1 and 10.3mgl1. A similar increase in inflow concentrations with either slight or no increase in outflow was observed for COD. Average inflow/outflow COD concentrations were 97/26mgl1 and 204/36mgl1, during the periods 1993–2002 and 2003–2006, respectively. There was no Table 5 substantial difference in inflow TSS concentrations between the two periods because during the first period the inflow concentrations were already high due to stormwater run-off (Table 5). This ability to treat low-strength wastewaters gives HF constructed wetlands advantage over conventional systems, which are not able to handle wastewaters with low organic content. Therefore, HF constructed wetlands could be also used for tertiary treatment with organics and TSS as target parameters. This is already commonly used in the United Kingdom [18]. Also, HF constructed wetlands can successfully cope with fluctuating concentrations of pollutants in the inflow with a stable outflow (Fig.3). Removal of TP and NH4-N (Table 6) was quite low but this is a typical feature of HF constructed wetlands [48]. Removal of phosphorus, however, can be enhanced by the use of special media with high sorption capacity, such as lightweight clay aggregates or blast/electric arc furnace steel slags [20].

Aboveground Biomass of Phragmites australis in Constructed Wetland Ond?rejov. Fig. 5. Aboveground Biomass of Phragmites australis in Constructed Wetland Spa´lene´ Po?r?´c?´?. The monitoring of Phragmites growth in Ondr?ejov (Fig. 4) revealed that it has taken four growing seasons to achieve its maximum biomass of 3013gm2. After 1997, the biomass started to decline, but after the winter harvest in early 2001, it again increased to 3017gm2, which is close to the average value of 3266gDMm2 reported forthePhragmitesgrowinginHFconstructedwetlands in the Czech Republic [49]. The maximum aboveground biomass in Spa´lene´ Por?´?c?´? (Fig.5) was also reached in the fourth growing season (2090gDMm2) and then it fluctuated very little between 1800 and 2060gDMm2. It was observed that Phragmites penetrated into Phalaris stands after 3 years and after six growing seasons it entirely out-competed Phalaris. However, this natural competition between two species does not affect the treatment performance of the system. 4. Conclusions ConstructedwetlandsinOnd?rejovandSpa´lene´ Po?r?´c?´? have been in operation since 1991 and 1992, respectively, and both systems belong to the oldest constructed wetlands in the Czech Republic. Both systems exhibited high and steady removal of organics and suspended solids. Removal of ammonium-N and total-P was steady but very low. However, these parameters were not targeted when designing these systems. The results from Spa´lene´ Por?´?c?´? also indicate that constructed wetlands can be used as tertiary treatment systems to polish organics and suspended solids. Both systems are examples of the suitable use of constructed wetlandsfor treatment of wastewaters from small settlements.
