Keywords cold clima e; dairy milking parlor; hybrid reed bed sys em; po a o s arch processing; swine urine IN RODUC ION Dairy milking parlor was ewa er, po a o s arch processing was ewa er and swine urine was ewa er’s rea men has been a big problem in Hokkaido, nor hern Japan because hese was ewa ers are pollu ing rivers and groundwa er. Conven ional mechanical was ewa er rea men s are expensive. So, here is an urgen need o apply a low cos echnology for he rea men of such kind of was ewa ers. Cons ruc ed we lands for pollu ion con rol have been grea ly progressed over he pas 20 years (P. Cooper 2009; J. Vymazal 2009; R. H. Kadlec e al. 2000). However here are s ill some limi a ions for he rea men of high con en was ewa er in cold clima es. So we designed and cons ruc ed a new hybrid reed bed sys em o rea high con en was ewa ers in he cold clima es be ween 2005 and 2009. We describe design and performance of all hese sys ems. SYS EM DESIGN AND ME HODS We designed, cons ruc ed and evalua ed he performance of six real scale hybrid reed bed plan s for rea ing high con en was ewa er in he cold clima e in Hokkaido, Nor hern Japan. he ou line of our plan s is shown in able 1 and able 2. here are four kinds of high con en was ewa er.

Wa er has been circula ing in some beds o improve performance mainly in growing season. Figure 1. Schema ic diagram of a hybrid reed bed sys em (N dairy farm). Sacrificial P-sorp ion ma erial was experimen ally used for purifica ion of phosphorus in K dairy, N dairy and P s arch fac ory, and he absorbed phosphorus would be recycled o farmland (Figure 1). We prepared organic ma er applica ion pool in fron of HF bed o accelera e deni rifica ion based on he resul from preliminary experimen in he labora ory s udies (Ka o e al. 2005, 2006). Bu we didn’ have chance o apply organic ma er because of excessive organic ma er in he rea ed wa er in real scale. Figure 2. Surface par i ion and reinforced safe y bypass (O pig farm). We measured he amoun of wa er flow and collec ed wa er samples a inle and ou le of each reed bed. he amoun of wa er flow was measured by coun ing movemen of each self-priming siphon. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), o al ni rogen ( -N), ammonium ni rogen (NH4-N), o al phosphorus ( -P) in he samples were analyzed in he labora ory.

Average purifica ion ra es were 70 - 96% for COD, 39 - 90% for -N, 36 - 82 % for NH4-N, 70 - 93 % for -P. Average load, removed load and oxygen ransfer ra e (O R) of o al sys em are shown in able 5.
