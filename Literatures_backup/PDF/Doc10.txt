© IWA Publishing 2011 Hydraulic behaviour and removal efficiencies of two H-SSF constructed wetlands for wastewater reuse with different operational life S. Barbagallo, G. L. Cirelli, A. Marzo, M. Milani and A. Toscano ABSTRACT This work focuses on the performance evaluation of two full-scale horizontal suburface flow constructed wetlands (H-SSF CWs) working in parallel, which have an almost equal surface area (about 2,000 m2) but with different operational lives: 8 and 3 years. Both H-SSF CWs, located in Southern Italy (Sicily), are used for tertiary treatment of the effluent of a conventional wastewater treatment plant. This study evaluates and compares H-SSF CW efficiency both in terms of water quality improvement (removal percentage) and achievement of Italian wastewater discharge and irrigation reuse limits. The mean removal percentage, for the overall operational life, of TSS, COD and BOD (80%, 63%, 58% obtained for H-SSF1 and 67%, 38%, 41% for H-SSF2), confirm the high reliability of CWs for wastewater treatment. However, despite the satisfactory removal of microbial indicators (the mean E. coli removal was up to 2.5 log unit for both beds), CWs didn’t achieve the Italian limits for wastewater reuse. Information on hydraulic properties of the CWs were extracted from breakthrough curves of a non-reactive tracer (NaCl). By comparing the nominal (?n) and actual residence time (?), hydraulic behaviour was revealed.

Toscano Department of Agrofood and Environmental System Management, University of Catania, Via S. Sofia 100, Catania 95123, Italy E-mail: alessia.marzo@unict.it Constructed wetlands (CWs), widely applied for the treatment of wastewater produced by residential settlements and industrial activities (Vymazal ????), are now standing as potential alternatives or supplementary systems for the treatment of wastewater, especially for small and medium communities wherelowmaintenanceand operationneedsareessential (Puigagut et al. ????). The removal efficiency of soluble pollutants in CWs is primarily related to the extent of contact between wastewaters and the their reactive surface/volume. Residence time distribution function (RTD) is a characteristic of wetland hydraulic properties as it describes a whole spectrum of time lengths that wastewater spends in the wetland (Ma?oszewski et al. ????). If a tracer pulse is added to an ideal wetland inlet, all of the tracer will exit at the same time, the residence time. In real wetlands, flow is non-ideal. Non-ideal flow comprises different flow velocities and mechanisms of diffusion, causing a distribution of residence times (Levenspiel ????). This paper describes the removal performance of CW technologies designed to treat thesecondaryeffluent ofmunicipal wastewater and the methodology followed to acquire doi: 10.2166/wst.2011.553 and analyse constructed wetland hydraulic behaviour by performing several tracer tests using sodium chloride as tracer. Water quality analyses, flow measurements and tracer tests were carried out in two horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (H-SSF1 and H-SSF2), one in operation since 2001 and the other since 2006. These wetlands, located in Southern Italy (Sicily), function as the tertiary treatment of the effluent of a conventional treatment plant, work in parallel and have an almost equal surface area (about 2,000 m2). METHODS Description of the wetland system The research was carried out in a full-scale constructed wetland treatment plant located in San Michele di Ganzaria (Eastern Sicily), a rural community of about 5,000 inhabitants, 90 km South-West of Catania. The experimental plant consists of two horizontal subsurface flow (H-SSF) constructed wetlands (CWs) working in parallel: H-SSF1 in operation since 2001 and H-SSF2 since 2006 (Cirelli et al. ????). These CWs are part of an almost completed wastewater reuse project, which included four H-SSF reed beds, working in parallel, followed by three batch stabilization reservoirs also working in parallel. In expectation of the wastewater reuse project being completed, only part of the secondary effluent of a conventional treatment plant, about 4 L/s, is diverted and treated by H-SSF1 and H-SSF2, which have a surface area of about 1,950 m2 (25 × 78 m) and 2,080 m2 (33 × 63 m) and a design flow rate of about 455 m3/day. The end section of the H-SSF2 reed bed (i.e. the last 3 m of the bed) functions as a free water surface with an area of about 190 m2. The filter beds are 0.6 m deep and filled with 8–10 mm gravel. Calcareous gravel (0.38 porosity) was used in the H-SSF1 and volcanic gravel (0.40 porosity) in H-SSF2. Nine piezometers were positioned along each bed to monitor wastewater quality. Both wetlands were planted with Phragmites australis at a density of four rhizomes/m2. Water quality analyses At the inlet and outlet of H-SSF1 (from 2001) and H-SSF2 (from 2007), the following physicochemical parameters were evaluated to December 2008 (about twice a month for HSFF1 and weekly for H-SSF2) according to APHA, AWWA, WEF (????) methods: total suspended solids (TSS) at 105 WC, BOD5, COD, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). Microbiological parameters, such as E. coli and Salmonella were also evaluated. E. coli was counted according to APHA (????) methods and Salmonella was examined according to Barbagallo et al. (????). Wastewater sampling has been done indifferent days for thetwo beds. Forthe physicochemicalparameters, the evaluation of treatment performance was based on the removal efficiency percentage. For microbiological parameters, log reductions were calculated. Furthermore, to characterize wetland treatment performance, a graphical display method was adopted. In particular, the input–output concentration (Ci–Co) graph was used in this research because it extends the idea of treatment ability to a group of wetlands (Kadlec ????). The multiple data sets are also represented by a linear trend and linear regression coefficient (R2). Tracer tests The salt tracer used to determine the actual residence time (?) ofthetwo full-scaleconstructedwetlandswassodium chloride (NaCl) as reported in other studies (e.g. Chazarenc et al. ????; Suliman et al. ????). In particular, three tests were performed at different flow rates in H-SSF1 and two tests in H-SSF2. The salt tracer was injected with a pump after dissolution of 150 kg NaCl in 450 L of wastewater. The injection times, which last about 10 minutes, may be considered practically instantaneous compared to the residence time of several days. The electrical conductivity (EC) was measured and recorded automatically by a probe with a data logger (Delta OHM – HD 2106.2) at the outlet of the bed. The EC values obtained in mS/cm were then converted to chloride concentrations by using calibration curves as suggested by Ronkanen & Kløve (????). A linear relationship (R2 ¼ 0.99) was found between salt concentration and EC. Before fitting the curve, the initial electrical conductivity was subtracted at each measuring point. A flow meter was installed in the inlet pipe. The flow rate was calculated as the ratio of total volume to the duration of the test and it was assumed constant. From the experimental RTD of each tracer test, actual residence times (?) and variance (?2), were calculated according to Levenspiel (????). The tail of the RTD curve was extrapolated assuming exponential decay, as suggested by Kadlec & Wallace (????), since at the end of the tests EC was higher than the background value. In order to characterize the hydraulic performance of a wetland, the hydraulic efficiency (ev) was calculated as the ratio of the actual (?) and theoretical retention time (?n), this latter calculated on a plug flow (PF) assumption as reported in IWA (????). By comparing ? and ?n,hydraulicbehaviourwasrevealed(Kadlec&Wallace????): • ?<<?n: fluid follows a preferential path. This is an indicator of short-circuiting; • ?>>?n: fluid stagnates in the reactor and does not participate in reactions. This phenomenon is due to the presence of dead or stagnant zones. Finally, the normalized variance of the tracer response curve was calculated to estimate the dispersion number (D), used to characterize the degree of the non-ideal flow conditions of the PF model. The equation for D estimation, by trial and error, was (Levenspiel ????): ?2? ¼ 2D 2D21 expD1 ð1Þ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION BOD5 and COD The inlet and outlet concentrations of BOD5 and COD for the entire period of record of each wetland are plotted in Figure 1. Each point represents single daily sampling. The H-SSF2 data clouds are mostly over the H-SSF1 data as the central tendency lines of the H-SSF1 are always lower than those of the H-SSF2. This highlights a generally better performance for H-SSF1 in BOD5 and COD. In fact, the mean organic matter removal, for the overall operation period, was about 60% in H-SSF1 and 40% in H-SSF2 (Tables 1 and 2). This could be explained by alga growth and decomposition occurring in the free water surface area at the end of the H-SSF2, which increase organic concentration in the effluent. Another possible explanation is that starting from the start-up of 2007, the mean influent concentrations detected were generally lower than in previous years, giving overall lower removal efficiency for the two beds. A poor relationship between inflow and outflow BOD5 concentrations, especially for H-SSF1 (R2 ¼ 0.16), was detected. Vymazal (????) and Brix (????) reported a similar poor relationship between inflow and outflow BOD5 concentrations for vegetated H-SSF CWs located in the Czech Republic (R2 ¼ 0.32) and Denmark (R2 ¼ 0.08). This means, in general, that the effluent concentration is around the background concentration and then the scattering is around it. TSS and E. coli Figure 2 presents input TSS versus output TSS concentration for both CWs and E. coli reduction through reed beds. There is no great difference in the performances for either parameter as the lack of separation of the data clouds show. The central tendency lines are essentially coincidental. Except for a few deviations, both systems produce a final effluent with TSS concentration less than 20 mg/L regardless of input level (up to 120 mg/L for H-SSF1 and 113 mg/L for H-SSF2). This performance was very stable over their entire operational periods (8 years for H-SSF1 and 3 for H-SSF2) and does not show any decrease. The mean TSS removal in H-SSF2 (67% ±20) was lower than that obtained in H-SSF1, but it is noted that the mean TSS concentration detected at the H-SSF2 influent was lower (Tables 1 and 2). There is very little or no difference in the results for H-SSF1 and H-SSF2 for E. coli reduction. Similar E. coli treatment trends for both wetlands were observed with a mean reduction more than 2.5 log units. In particular, E. coli, were reduced to a mean value of 2.7 Ulog (±0.8) (incoming range 4.5– 5.3 Ulog) in the effluent of H-SSF1 and a mean value of 2.6 Ulog (±0.8) in H-SSF2 (incoming range 5.3–5.4 Ulog). There is little relationship between input and output E. coli concentration in either CW (R2 4). TN and TP Figure 3 presents nitrogen and phosphorus input versus output data for the studied systems. For TP, there is little or no difference between the two beds. The shallower slope of the H-SSF2 regression line highlights the ability of the bed to maintain TN effluent characteristics unchanged despite the variation inlet concentration. This could demonstrate the ability of algae and microphytes to remove TN directly on the open water surface at the end of H-SSF2. Despite plant uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus generally being non-significant for their removal, a positive effect of the plants was observed. In the first year of H-SSF2 operation, its average removal efficiency of nutrient (60 to 46% for TN and TP) was higher than that in the H-SSF1 bed in 2001 (29 to 31% for TN and TP) (Tables 1 and 2).

Samples were collected at the beginning of plant growth in H-SSF1, while the sampling survey began when the plants were already fully developed in H-SSF2. Wastewater discharge and reuse limits It could be deceptive to evaluate constructed wetland performance just according to removal efficiency.

For this reason, samples expressed as percentages below the wastewater Italian limits for discharge into surface waters (D. Lgs. 152/2006) and for agriculture reuse (DM 185/2003) have been calculated. World Health Organization guidelines (WHO ????) for wastewater reuse have been also taken in account. In both effluents, COD and TSS concentrations were always below the Italian discharge concentration (35 and 125 mg/L, respectively). Furthermore, the two wetlands always reduced COD to acceptable concentrations for irrigation (100 mg/L). Just a few samples (1 out of 80 for H-SSF1 and 5 out of 35 for H-SSF2) didn’t comply with the BOD5 limit of 25 mg/L for discharge into surface water. Both effluent nitrogen concentrations met the legal requirements for irrigation (35 mg/L) while the phosphorus limit (10 mg/L) was only exceeded by 3% (H-SSF1) and 5% (H-SSF2) of the samples. Despite constructed wetlands having shown good removal of microbial indicators (more than 2.5 log unit) did not show the ability to produce effluent with E. coli levels matching the Italian wastewater reuse standard (50 UFC/100 ml [Maximum value to be detected in 80% samples for natural treatment systems.]). Only 35 and 27% of samples collected at the outlets of H-SSF1 and H-SSF2, were below the maximum E. coli value limit imposed by the law. This result highlights the need for further treatment to achieve the Italian limits required for irrigation reuse. On the other hand, the numbers of E. coli in the H-SSF1 and H-SSF2 effluent (always 103 E. coli per 100 ml) ensure that health-based targets proposed by the WHO (????) are Figure 2 | Performance of H-SSF2 and H-SSF1 wetland for TSS (a) and E. coli (b) reduction.

The performance was good for Salmonella removal, which was never detected in the effluent of CWs, despite always being revealed in the influent. Tracer experiments The concentration curves versus normalized time (?¼?/?n) obtained in all the tests conducted in H-SSF1 have nearly identical shapes (Figure 4(a)). All three curves displayed a sharp rise to a peak, followed by an exponential decrease with a long tail. In March 2009, the total sampling period for the tracer test conducted in H-SSF1 was approximately 254 h. The June and July tests in H-SSF1, concluded at 143 and 163 h. The high mass tracer recovery both in the March (97%) and July (80%) test indicates that the tracer experiments were carried out well in H-SSF1. The mass recovery in June was lower (70%) probably due to a shorter test duration. In H-SSF1 the nominal residence time, assuming unchanged nominal porosity (0.38), was always higher than ? (Table 3). The ev values agree with the values reported in U.S. EPA (????) indicating that ? in many horizontal SSF systems is frequently 40–80% less than ?n, because of loss of pore volume, dead volume or preferential flow. The dispersion numbers (D) obtained in tracer tests performed in March and June in H-SSF1 fit well with the range of 0.07– 0.35 quoted by King et al. (????) and Simi & Mitchell (????) for other H-SSF CWs. None of the tests had a dispersion number lower than 0.025, which is indicative of near PF conditions (U.S. EPA ????). In both tracer tests carried out in the H-SSF2, the mass recovery was very low (about 24%) probably due to further dilution of the tracer in the free water surface at the end of the bed. This affected the calculation of hydraulic Table 3 | Values of the parameters that define the hydraulic behaviour of the H-SSF1 and H-SSF2 Test Q (L/s) ?n (h) ?

For example, tracer peak time (tp) in the August test was recorded later than the April test, despite having a higher flow rate (Table 3). The peaks, observed in both tests carried out in H-SSF2, indicate the presence of separate flow paths (Figure 4(b)). Two other salt tracer tests were carried out in H-SSF1 by measuring the EC variation (mS/cm) in the piezometers (sampling locations) where the probes were places in parallel (Figure 5(a)) in the first experiment and in series (Figure 5(b)), during the second one. Breakthrough curves measured in three parallel piezometers (4, 5 and 6, see upper part of Figure 5(a)) confirm that channelling was occurring since the three breakthroughs exhibit different times of arrival. The RTDs measured in the piezometers placed in series (Figure 5(b)), support the presence of zones with stagnant (immobile) water which do not participate in reactions, as it is possible to see in piezometer number 8, where the EC values remained almost unchanged. CONCLUSIONS The analysis of RTDs across different flow rates, showed a mean actual residence time always lower than the nominal hydraulic residence time. This was probably due to the presence of dead volumes or preferential flow paths, confirmed by breakthrough curves measured in piezometers inside the H-SSF1. Despite the flow conditions being far from the PF model, the constructed wetlands located in San Michele di Ganzaria (Sicily), have proved to be efficient in removing the main chemical and physical pollutants from the secondary effluent of urban wastewater treatment plants. The E. coli removal was up to 2.5 log units for both beds and the average effluent concentrations were 2.6 log units (H-SSF2) and 2.7 log units (H-SSF1); this microbiological indicator didn’t respect the Italian standard for wastewater reuse but complied with the WHO guidelines. In any case, the results of this study confirm the high reliability of CWs for tertiary wastewater treatment given that the H-SSF1 treatment capacity remained largely unchanged after eight years of operation.
